# This is the implementation of the Java Socket Server 

## Here we are building a chatting application using Java Socket Server 

### Main elements:
1. Server File
2. Client File 

To establish a successful connection between both ends, we need to run the Server code and then the client code <br>

Once both the codes are running we can chat using two different interfaces.  <br>

Here are the interfaces:
